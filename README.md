# Balance-Market-Forecast

This repository contains code and datasets used for forecasting in both the Day-Ahead (DAM) market and the balancing market (BM).

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to analyze and compare different forecasting models for both the DAM and BM markets, aiming to improve price forecasting accuracy.

## Data Access
Access to the full Day-Ahead market dataset and balancing market dataset via Google Drive link has been removed temporarily while the paper is under review. However, subsets of both datasets, reduced to 25mb in size as per GitHub's restriction, are available in the 'Datasets' folder.

## Code
- 'DAM and BM Results': Contains code for processing DAM and BM results.
- 'Forecasting Library & Hyper-parameter Search': This file contains code for forecasting with each individual model and conducting hyperparameter search for each model.

Please note that access to the full datasets and additional code may be provided upon request or after the paper's review process is complete.
